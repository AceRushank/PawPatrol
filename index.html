            <p>Our mission is to create a safer environment by providing a platform for reporting stray dog attacks. Through this initiative, we aim to protect both people and animals from harm. By collecting and sharing information about stray dog incidents, we can help communities take proactive measures to prevent future attacks.</p>
            <p>Raising awareness about the issue of stray dogs is also a crucial part of our mission. We believe that by educating the public, we can foster a greater understanding and compassion towards stray dogs. This can lead to more effective solutions that ensure the safety and well-being of everyone in our communities.</p>

                <p>In a town where shadows roam,<br>
                    A lonely stray without a home,<br>
                    Wanders streets in search of care,<br>
                    Finding none, it's left to fare.</p>
                <p>With a heart that's worn and sore,<br>
                    Seeking love, it finds closed doors,<br>
                    In its eyes, a plea so sad,<br>
                    For a friend it never had.</p>
                <p>But in our hearts, we'll make a space,<br>
                    For every lost and furry face,<br>
                    To bring them in from nights so cold,<br>
                    A tale of hope that must be told.</p>
